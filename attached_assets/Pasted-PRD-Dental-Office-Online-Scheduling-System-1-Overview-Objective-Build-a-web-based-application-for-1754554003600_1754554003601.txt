PRD: Dental Office Online Scheduling System
1. Overview
Objective:
Build a web-based application for a dental clinic that allows patients to book, manage, and view dental appointments online. The system will serve both patients and clinic staff and will be deployed on scalable AWS infrastructure, with a focus on clean architecture, modularity, and operational efficiency.

2. User Roles
Patient

Register, log in, and manage personal information

View dental services

Book, reschedule, or cancel appointments

Admin / Clinic Staff

Manage dentist schedules and availability

View and manage all appointments

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Frontend (Client-Side Web App)
Tech: Framework-agnostic (e.g., React recommended).
UI Library: Use shadcn/ui for all components.

Key Pages & Components
Home Page

Display clinic info, services, and a prominent “Book Appointment” CTA

Booking Page

Select dentist, choose date and time slot from availability

Confirm and submit appointment booking

User Dashboard

View upcoming and past appointments

Edit, reschedule, or cancel bookings

Manage personal profile

Authentication Pages

Register / Login / Logout / Password reset flows

Admin Panel (optional but recommended)

Manage dentists and their time slots

View appointment logs

3.2 Backend (Server-Side API)
Architecture: RESTful API. Modular service-based code structure.

Core Functionalities
User Authentication

Secure registration, login, and session handling (e.g., JWT)

Password hashing, email verification (optional)

Appointments Management

Create, read, update, and cancel appointments

Filter appointments by user or dentist

Dentist Schedule Management

Set and update dentist availability

Profile Management

Edit name, email, phone, password

Example Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Description
/auth/register	POST	Create a new patient account
/auth/login	POST	Login user and return token
/appointments	POST	Book a new appointment
/appointments/:id	PUT	Reschedule appointment
/appointments/:id	DELETE	Cancel appointment
/appointments/user/:id	GET	Get a user’s appointments
/dentists	GET	List dentists
/availability/:dentistId	GET	Get available slots

4. Database Design
Database:
Use Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for managing relational data.

Schema Overview
Users Table
id (UUID, PK)

name

email (unique)

password_hash

phone

created_at, updated_at

Dentists Table
id (UUID, PK)

name

specialization

created_at, updated_at

Appointments Table
id (UUID, PK)

user_id (FK → Users)

dentist_id (FK → Dentists)

appointment_time (datetime)

status (Scheduled, Cancelled, Rescheduled, Completed)

created_at, updated_at

Availability Table (Optional for flexibility)
id (UUID)

dentist_id (FK)

available_date (date)

time_slots (json/text array)

5. Deployment & Infrastructure
5.1 Containerization & Kubernetes
Containerize backend and frontend using Docker

Deploy to AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Use Kubernetes Secrets, ConfigMaps, and Ingress for secure routing and config

5.2 AWS Services (Required)
Component	AWS Service	Purpose
Database	Amazon RDS	Relational data store for users, appointments, and dentists
Static Assets	Amazon S3	Store frontend build artifacts, images, and backups
Orchestration	Amazon EKS	Run containers with autoscaling and service discovery
DNS & TLS	Route 53 + ACM	Domain routing and SSL certificate management
Monitoring	CloudWatch	Monitor logs, metrics, and alerts
Secrets	AWS Secrets Manager	Secure storage for DB creds and auth tokens
Notifications	SES or SNS (Optional)	Email/SMS alerts for appointment reminders

6. Optional Enhancements
Appointment Reminders via email or SMS

Admin Role Management for dentist and appointment visibility

Rate Limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints

Audit Logging for appointment changes or deletions

Multi-language Support for diverse patient demographics

7. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: Autoscaling with Kubernetes and database read replicas (if needed)

Security: Encrypted data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (RDS encryption)

Reliability: Multi-AZ deployment for high availability

Performance: Responsive UI, optimized queries, and minimal downtime

Compliance: HIPAA-aligned if applicable for region or market

8. UI/UX Guidelines
Follow consistent UI design using shadcn/ui

Mobile-first and responsive design

Prioritize accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)

9. Documentation Requirements
The project must include:

README with Setup Instructions

API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

Database ERD

System Architecture Diagram

Deployment Guide (Kubernetes & AWS Setup)
